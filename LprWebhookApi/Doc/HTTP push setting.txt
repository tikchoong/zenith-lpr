I. HTTP server configuration

1. Using HTTP push first requires the user to establish an HTTP server and
configure the address of the HTTP server to the camera all-in-one;

2. When the all-in-one has an identification result (or other content that
needs to be pushed), an HTTP protocol message is sent to the specified server
address;

3. On the All-in-One web page, after logging in, click on the menu bar - >
Advanced Settings - > HTTP push, and enter the settings interface for HTTP
push (slightly different versions);

4. The server that receives HTTP push, configured to include address (ip
address or domain name can be filled in), port number, whether to turn on ssl
connection,ssl port number, and timeout setting. Please configure according to
the condition of the server set up;


5. Http servers can be configured with 1 primary server, up to 3 alternate
servers, if the primary server is checked first, the camera is pushed only to the
primary server, and only when the primary server is disconnected, to the
alternate server, and if the primary service is not checked first, data is pushed
to   the primary/standby server at the same time;

6. HTTP push specific configuration, i.e. what HTTP needs to push,

including license plate recognition results,IO trigger, serial 485 data, needs to
be configured for the u rlpush.

7. HTTP heartbeat is divided into cancel heartbeat, normal
heartbeat,comet polling;comet polling has been interacting with the server push
heartbeat,  and the server can carry business processing in reply messages;


8. HTTP offline check, when the offline check is turned on, the camera will
check HTTP offline, offline check is divided into heartbeat check and recognition
results check, heartbeat check is normal heartbeat time check, recognition
results check when the recognition results are generated, push recognition
results need to receive a reply from the server during the check time, otherwise
the camera will be offline, when the camera is offline, offline related business
processing;

9. Configure the number of reisuses, up to 4 times, that is, when a push is
generated, if the push is not successful, the camera will reiser the push data;

Second, license plate identification results push

When push license plate recognition results are turned on and push url is
configured, the camera sends a message to: when the license plate recognition
results are generated
http://192.168.1.106/devicemanagement/php/plateresult.php；

Note: With the addition of HTTP retransive, license plate recognition results
push messages have increased compared to older versions

3 fields are:plateid,isoffline,gioouts;

Data content:JSON format(utf8 encoding).

Note: After adding http retranslation, you need to use this feature, the server's
reply must carry the plateid field, consistent with the value pushed by the camera;
Center server replies:

2.1 Broken Retransm

1. When the HTTP server is disconnected from the server for some reason, the
camera records the identification results of the push failure as offline records, and when
the server is reconnected, the camera determines whether an offline record needs to be
pushed according to the configuration, while sending an offline record;

2. Configuration in the web page configuration, turn on the disconnect retransive function,
note that when the cancellation of the disconnect retranspiration function, will empty the
current camera offline records;


3. The camera push recognition results, compared to the older version of the push
message, add three new fields:plateid, isoffline, gioouts, offline record isoffline with a value
of    1;

4. When the server replies to the camera recognition results, the online record needs to
reply the plateid field value to the camera message;

5. When the server replies to offline recognition results, it needs to reply to whether it
continues to receive offline records and receives the latest

plateid；

6. Offline offline records theoretically support the re-push of up to 9000 offline records;

7. In the process of pushing offline records, if a new recognition result occurs,
priority push new recognition results, at this time the push of offline records is
not completed, will directly terminate processing, when the new identification
results are pushed out, the party starts pushing offline records again; Note:
When pushing offline records, the camera has not yet received a response
from  the server, a new recognition result is generated, the camera terminates
the push processing of the previous offline record, directly pushes the new
identification results, when the new recognition results are pushed, Push on to
an   offline record, so the server may receive two identical offline records at this
time, the server can filter according to plateid;

Third, the port triggers the information push

When on, if an external input 1 trigger or 2 trigger is turned on in the input and
output page -> license plate trigger mode, the json format data is pushed when
there is a change in the input, as follows:

Data content:JSON format(utf8 encoding).


{

"AlarmGioIn" : {

"deviceName" : "IVS", "ipaddr" :

"192.168.109.40", "result" :

{

"TriggerResult" :

{

"source" : 3,.

"value" : 1

}

},

"serialno" : "d85b1269-8f942256" }

}

Among them,TriggerResult:

"Source=0 means IO input 1;
source=1 means IO input 2; and
source=2 means yes." IO input 3;
source=3 represents input TCP
trigger input;

Source=4 means IO input 4;

Value represents the state entered at the time of trigger;

Central server reply content: any legitimate data, the camera does not reply to
messages business processing

Fourth, serial data push

When serial data push is turned on, the urlis configured to actively push 485 data to
the server address when the camerareceives 485 data;

Data content:JSON format(utf8 encoding).


{

"SerialData":{

"channel": 0, / channel number, currently 0

"serialno": "cead13eb-1a198cd7", / device serial number
"ipaddr": "192.168.1.100", / Device ip

"deviceName":  "IVS",    / Device name

"serialChannel": 0, / Channel number for serial port, channel 0 for 485 port

"data": "Y2guY29tFw",/ serial data, encoded with base64
"dataLen": 7/ Actual length of serial data

}

}

Central server reply content: any legitimate data, the camera does not reply to
messages business processing

V. Screenshot data

The device makes the current video when the user has a screenshot in the comet poll
or in the reply field that receives the identification results

Screenshot and upload,imageFIle field encoded after picture base64, imageFileLen for
pre-encoding picture length Data content:JSON format(utf8 encoding)

Push screenshot data

{

"ipaddr" : "192.168.1.100",

"TriggerImage": {

"imageFile":"Y2guY29tFw", // Image data(base64 encoding).

"imageFileLen":7                 / The actual length of the picture data

}

}

Central server reply content: any legitimate data, the camera does not reply to
messages business processing

Sixth, equipment registration

6.1 Normal heartbeat

1. When the camera web page configuration device enrollment status is normal
heartbeat, the camera regularly pushes a heartbeat message to the primary server:

2. When the main service connection is normal, turn on offline checking, the camera
every 5S or so to push the heartbeat;

3. When the primary service is connected properly and offline checking is not turned
on, a heartbeat message is pushed by 30S;


4. When the main service heartbeat is lost, the camera tries to connect every 1S;

5. Heartbeat push uses http://www.heartbeat push using http://www.heartbeat push

Data content, in formpost format:

192.168.109.40         caa771fe4a61f3d9Content-Disposition: form-data;

name="device_name"IVS         caa771fe4a61f3d9Content-Disposition: form-data;

data; name="channel_num" 1--------------------------caa771fe4a61f3d9--

6.2 Comet Polling

1.   When comet polling is turned on, the camera will always interact with the
HTTP server, keep the connection request, the camera actively send the device
registration message, the content is consistent with the normal heartbeat content,
receive a reply, immediately send the next message;

2.  Send a device registration message, consistent with a normal heartbeat
message;

3.   Comet polling will be handled accordingly based on server replies;

Seven, business processing

1. The camera carries on the corresponding business processing according to the
reply message of the server.

2. Currently only support push replies for license plate recognition results, as well as
comet poll message replies, the camera will do business based on the responses;

7.1 Control IO open gate

When the server receives a push of license plate recognition results, or a comet poll, it
replies to a message from the following structure that triggers an open gate


{

"Response_AlarmInfoPlate":

{

"info":"ok",/ Reply to ok open the gate

/  Other data

}

}

7.2 Control serial push 485 data

When the server receives a license plate recognition result push, or comet poll, it replies to
a message from the following structure that sends 485 data

{

"Response_AlarmInfoPlate": {
"serialData" :[

{

"serialChannel":0,
"data" : "...",
"dataLen" : 123

},

Data 1,which can or may not be received, will be sent to the corresponding serial
port upon receipt

"serialChannel":1,
"data" : " ",

"dataLen" : 123

/ Data 2,which can or may not be received, will be sent to the corresponding serial
port

]

/  Other data

}

}

7.3 Screenshot

When the server receives a push of license plate recognition results, or a comet poll, it
replies to a message from the following structure that triggers a screenshot:

The camera triggers the current video screenshot and then pushes the screenshot data to
the server address specified in the SnapImage AbsolutelyUrl field;


{

"Response_AlarmInfoPlate":

{

"TriggerImage" : {

Reply to the screenshot content port number (optional, do not fill in the default use

http page configuration port).
"port":80,

Reply to the relative path of the screenshot content (optional, no screenshot is
triggered but the field is not added).

"snapImageRelativeUrl" : "/devicemanagement/php/receivedeviceinfo.php",

Reply to the absolute path of the screenshot content (optional, no screenshot is
triggered but the field is not added).

"snapImageAbsolutelyUrl":"http://192.168.1.106/devicemanagement/php/receivedevicein fo.php"

}

/  Other data

}

}

7.4 Manual trigger recognition

When the server receives a push of license plate recognition results, or a comet poll, it
replies to a message from the following structure that triggers manual identification:

{

"Response_AlarmInfoPlate": {

"manualTrigger": "ok",/ Reply ok for manual triggering

/  Other data

}

}

Or reply only to the following data:

This triggers the manual identification of the camera, and the device pushes the
identification result data to the http service side, provided that the service side
is configured to push the identification data;


7.5 Whitelist operation

When the central server receives the identification results of HTTP push, it carries the
whitelist operation information in the identification result message of the reply Note:
Single reply message, up to 5 whitelist data;

1. Reply messages are in JSON format, as follows

{

"Response_AlarmInfoPlate": {

...// Other data

3. Message example:

Add two whitelist data at the same time (multiple data, in the same format):


Article 1 If there is no valid time for whitelisting, the default white list shall be valid
permanently;

Article 2 A whitelist is valid for a period of time, indicating that the current whitelist is
valid for that period of time;

{

"Response_AlarmInfoPlate": {

...// Other data

"white_list_operate":{
"operate_type" : 0,
"white_list_data": [

{

"plate": "King A12345",
"enable": 1,

"need_alarm": 0

},

{

"plate": "Kawa A12345",
"enable": 1,

"need_alarm": 0,

"enable_time": "2018-01-01 11:11:11",

"overdue_time": "2019-01-01 11:11:11" }

]

}

}

}

4. Example of a reply message that removes two whitelists:


{

"Response_AlarmInfoPlate": {

...// Other data

"white_list_operate":{

"operate_type" : 1,
"white_list_data": [

{


}, {

}

]

}

}

}

"plate": "King A12345"
"plate": "Kawa A12345"

5. Example of a reply message that removes all whitelists:

{

"Response_AlarmInfoPlate": {

...// Other data

"white_list_operate":{

Eight, frequently asked questions

Q:What is device registration?

A:When turned on, the device information is automatically sent to the central
server at regular intervals, including device ip,port, serial number, and so on.

Q:Set up, request can not be received, what problem?

A:Make sure that the all-in-one has access to the appropriate address for the
central server. Common problems such as, within the local area network,
whether the network line is connected, ip address conflicts, whether in the
accessible segment, if the central server is on the public network, make sure


that the all-in-one can access the public network, need to set up the all-in-one
gateway and dns address. Check that the central server is running.

Q:The request was received, but no data (data format is not correct)?

A:The license plate recognition result push request sends json data, http's body
content such as

{"AlarmInfoPlate":{...}}

Reception methods such as:

php：

$doc = file_get_contents("php://input"); java:

StringBuffer jb = new StringBuffer(); String
line = null;

try {

BufferedReader reader = request.getReader();

while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null)
jb.append(line);

Q:Central server, received push results, reply to all-in-one, but do not see the
specific content returned, how to debug the central server?

A:You can view the logs of the access center server on the Web page, and you can see
what the central server replies to the all-in-one.

Q: When multiple cameras are polling with comet at the same time, the central
server is under too much pressure, causing the server to fail to respond?

A: comet polling mechanism, for the camera loop to the center server to push the
heartbeat package data, when the server received a push, reply response, the camera
immediately started the next heartbeat package push, there is no timer in the middle and
other delays;

So when the number of cameras is large, use comet to push to a server at the same time,
pay attention to server performance;
